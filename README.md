# Abstract
Heat waves and rising temperatures represent a growing threat to public health and safety from a personal level to a country level. This study explores the impacts of extreme heat and rising temperatures on two typical regions prone to climate change: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and California, USA. The research highlights the influence of long-lasting heat wave areas on individual health by examining Riyadh hospital admissions. It also demonstrates the rising threats of wildfires in California associated with the rising temperatures over past decades. At last, the article investigates topics that news usually covers related to heatwaves and rising temperatures.
